# ASTR5160

## Spring 2025

This repository is for my Astro Techniques II assignments and codes.

Code for ASTR-5160 at the Uniersity of Wyoming.

So far this semester, we have learned a number of topics to help us succeed as astronomers. These include map projections, spherical caps, coordinate transformations and more.

The Python packages we have used so far include (but are not limited to) astropy Coordinates and Units, and PyMangle. All imported packages are located at the top of each file.
